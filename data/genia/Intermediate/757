HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mrs. Jesus Wigham , whose past medical history includes diabetes , hypertension , and multiple prior coronary interventions -LRB- ballooned -RRB- , presents in a stable state for elective coronary artery bypass graft , after a cardiac catheterization showed two vessel disease . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : On 23 of November the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting , left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to left coronary artery and then to obtuse marginal . 
After surgery the patient became hypotensive and ischemic . 
A new angiogram was performed which showed three vessel coronary artery disease , an occluded sequential venous graft to obtuse marginal and left coronary artery , and a patent left internal mammary artery graft . 
The patient was reoperated ; a new coronary artery bypass graft was performed on 23 of June , a new vein graft was placed to the right posterior descending artery and another one to the obtuse marginal . 
An intra-aortic balloon pump had been previously placed and was removed three days later . 
OTHER EVENTS DURING HOSPITAL STAY : 1 . 
Volume over-load for which the patient has still some fluid retention and is still being on diuretics . 
2 . 
The patient underwent multiple interventions in her groins , mostly for placement of arterial lines and intra-aortic balloon pump . 
Some hematoma developed but it never worsened . 
Vascular Surgery was consulted but no further intervention was done . 
3 . 
A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after her surgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet . 
Infectious Disease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis as the patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease said that this was the reason for her redness . 
In the last two days of her stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit more visible , and there was some question of increased white blood cells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should be continued for about seven more days . 
4 . 
The patient is on three days of levofloxacen treatment for a urinary tract infection . 
5 . 
When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time , a Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed no obstruction to venous flow . 
6 . 
The patient also went for a period in atrial fibrillation and was treated and converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockers , namely Lopressor . 
CURRENT CONDITION : At present the patient is in stable condition , afebrile , heart rate 81 in sinus , blood pressure 120/60 , respiratory rate 20 , with a saturation of 96 % in room air . 
Her blood sugar is 189 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 151 , white blood cells 10.7 , hematocrit 28.4 , and INR 1.4 . 
The list of medications is included in the discharge summary . 
Thank you for accepting this patient .
