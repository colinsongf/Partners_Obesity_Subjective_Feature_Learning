She also noted bilateral LEE , PND , and fatigue . 
She has HTN that was well-controlled , so as her DM II . 
Her last Echo in 2004 showed EF of 60 % with LVH . 
ROS is otherwise negative for orthopnea , change in appetite , or weight , new flu - like symptoms , history of DVT and pain in calfs .

**** Hospital course : This is a lovely 79 year-old lady with multiple risk factors for atheroscosis , including long standing HTN with evidence of LVH on Echo from 2004 , DM II complicated by neuropathy , hyperlipidemia , and age . 
She presented with overt symptoms and clinical signs of congestive heart failure , including complaints of progressive shortness of breath , PND , fatigue , and peripheral edema . 
Her physical exam was significant for an elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displaced PMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure . 
Even though the patient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60 % , suggesting a recent development of CHF . 
Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB , and no QW . 
Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB , and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had a recent ischemic event . 
Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative during her first 24 hours stay . 
She had a stress MIBI showing no scars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23 % . 
An Echo showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normal pulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy . 
Extensive interviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies of HF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMP remained undifined . 
she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , responded well to PO Lasix -LRB- 40-60mg -RRB- , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , and Spironolactone 12.5 mg . 
Her symptos completely resolved both at rest and with gentle ambulation . 
One can argue toward evaluating her coronaray arteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia . 
However considering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo with globaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her . 
she will be evaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered . 
She will follow up with Dr. Rafael Abeita .
