INFORMATION ** Presentation : 73 yo F with PMH of AS AVA 0.74 cm2 , median gradient 36 mmHg , multiple CHF exacs in past , DM , HTN , clinically in CHF exacerbation . 
PMH : worsening AS AVA 074 cm2 , LVEF 65 % , mild TR , hypothyroidism , DM on insulin , CKD Final Diagnosis : CHF exacerbation Treatment and Response : Note that it was very difficult to monitor her fluid status - JVP difficult 2/2 girth of neck , often incontinent so I/O inaccurate , and has chronic leg edema 2/2 PVD . 
Therefore , we adjusted diuretic regimen primarily by how she symptomatically felt and her weights . 
Initially treated with Torsemide 200 iv bid , Zaroxylyn 5 mg po bid -LRB- 30 min before torsemide -RRB- , and Aldactone 25 po bid . 
She diuresed well to this . 
Over the course of hospital stay , her creatinine increased from 1.6 to 2.2 , and though her baseline is 1.6-2 .0 , we used this , along with her symptomatic improvement and return of weight to dry weight of 114.5 kg , to establish euvolemia . 
For final 3 days of stay on home regimen of torsemide 150 po bid , zaroxlyn 5 po qd , and aldactone 25 po bid and had stable weights . 
Relevant Data : Weight at d/c 114.5 ; VS @ d/c 98.0 , 81 , 106/60 , 20 , 93 on RA ; rales at left base Brief Hospital Course : See above for CHF related info In addition , pt was found to have pan-sensitive E-coli UTI - treated with Bactrim x 7 days . 
Two days before discharge her initial cough worsened in severity and became somewhat productive . 
She never mounted a WBC , never was febrile , and CXR showed no infiltrate . 
Felt to be 2/2 underlying COPD - improved significantly with nebulizer tx and Robitussen . 
During hospital stay , she was evaluated for home 02 ; however , her ambulatory 02 sat was 94 % and her nocturnal O2 sats -LRB- done by respiratory therapy -RRB- were 89-93 % . 
Therefore , not discharged on home 02 , though may want to consider as outpt .
