Hospital course complicated by episodes of sinus brady to 30 's w / 4-6 sec pauses , asx , evaluated by EP , no need for PPM at present . 
** 1 -RRB- R lower ext Ulcer and cellulitis - cellulitis initially treated with nafcillin IV for 5 days with improvement in both swelling , erythema , and pain . 
Discharge from the wound was cultured and grew out Ecoli and Enterobacter , sensitive to cipro . 
Abx were switched to cipro which would provide coverage for the gram negatives growing from her wound and also cover her cellulitis . 
She will complete a total abx course of 12 days -LRB- additional 5 days of cipro -RRB- . 
There was an initial concern for DVT but LENIS were negative . 
Zinc and Vit C were added to her regimen . 
She will also need Wound changes with NS wet to dry BID . 
The ulcer is most likely due to poor wound healing in the setting of chronic venous stasis . 
It was also noted that she had very weak LE pulse so vascualar surgery was consulted . 
She was found to have + peripheral pulses by doppler , and follow up with vascular surgery was set up for her . 
She will also get umaboots and ABI at her followup . 
*** 2 -RRB- bradycardia : to 30 's during sleep . 
Pt came in on atenolol which we discontinued , esecially in the setting of CRI . 
No tachyarrythmia on Tele . 
Good HR response w / actviity up to 70s . 
Evaluated by EP and felt that she was not a candidate for a PPM at this point , especially since her bradycardia is assymptomatic . 
It was felt that her bradycardia is most likely due to her OSA , and that she would benefit from a sleep study . 
If her bradycardia does not improve after treatment of her OSA , then she will need to follow up with EP for further evaluation .
