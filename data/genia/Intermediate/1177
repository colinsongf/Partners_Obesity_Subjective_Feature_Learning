The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February , 2003 . 
CC : Hypotension after dialysis HPI : 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF -LRB- EF 20-25 % -RRB- admitted for hypotension after HD . 
He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he developed stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough . 
He denied recent travels , and had remote Abx use . 
At Stodun Hospital , he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30 . 
1 liter of NS was given and his BP rose to 73/40 .

The BP rose after fluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema . 
Although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about new ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED . 
Hospital course 1 . 
CVS : Ischemia : NSTEMI : contined medical management with asa , beta blocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn . 
The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4 . 
His cardiologist -LRB- Dr Benisek -RRB- recommended PET scan to assess for viable myocardium and ischemia . 
His last stress test 1 year ago showed only scarring with no ischemia . 
In the past , pt 's wife refused for him to go for CABG . 
They are reconsidering this option currently . 
The results of the PET scan are as follows : - A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild residual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD distribution . 
- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction . 
- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February , 2003 . 
The family was called to stress the importance of follow up with cardiology -LRB- They have missed appointments in the past -RRB- Pump : -LRB- EF 20-25 % -RRB- , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and pending and echo revealed EF 30 % , Mod AI . 
Rhythm : no events occurred on telemetry 2 . 
Pulm : monitored sats with fluid restriction . 
RA sats improved to 97 % 3 . 
Renal : HD MWF , home renal meds . 
He was dialyzed to a weight below his previous baseline per cardiology recommendations . 
In the past he has had elevated RH filling pressures after HD . 
The Ryi was called by the attendting renal physician -LRB- Dr. Slemp -RRB- about his goal weight . 
4 . 
ID : Blood cx were no growth 5 . 
GI : He was continued on his home nexium 6 . 
Proph : SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis ADDITIONAL COMMENTS : It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with the cardiologist , Dr Ivrin Please take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on mornings of dialysis Please adhere to your dietary restrictions . 
If you gain more than 3 kg between dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake . 
The diet guidelines will be coordinated by the staff at Chapmed Gamette Medical Center DISCHARGE CONDITION : Stable TO DO/PLAN : see above No dictated summary ENTERED BY : PASSINO , TERRY D. , M.D. -LRB- VO9 -RRB- 1/5/04 @ 11 ****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******
