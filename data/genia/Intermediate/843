She has a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and has been receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatments . 
She presented outside the window for thrombolysis or intervention . 
Exam revealed plegia of the left face and arm , paresis of the left leg , and an incomplete neglect syndrome . 
MRI/MRA revealed partial right MCA territory stroke and suggested severe proximal right ICA stenosis ; she was placed on heparin . 
Antihypertensives , aside from low-dose metoprolol , were held . 
CT/CTA head and neck the following day confirmed a severe proximal right ICA stenosis and revealed evolution of the stroke to involve much of the right MCA territory . 
The heparin was discontinued and the patient placed back on clopidogrel . 
The Hoaggan Memorial Hospital under Dr. Aiu evaluated the patient and recommended a follow-up appointment with him two weeks after discharge . 
Laboratory work-up pertinent to stroke revealed a normal homocysteine , normal TSH , lipid profile with LDL 108 , HDL 52 , TG 131 , and Lp -LRB- a -RRB- lipoprotein elevated at 93 . 
She was continued on a statin , and low-dose niacin added to the regimen because of the Lp -LRB- a -RRB- results . 
Her hemoglobin A1c and random blood sugars were elevated ; she received an insulin sliding scale . 
Echocardiogram showed normal LVEF and size , no wall motion abnormalities , + evidence of diastolic dysfunction , and normal LA size . 
Her cell counts trended downward in an expected fashion given the timing of her most recent chemotherapy . 
She was placed on neutropenic precautions . 
Her oncologist Dr. Batrez recommended administering prophylactic ciprofloxacin and a single dose of long-acting G-CSF . 
She is not planned to receive any additional chemotherapeutic or radiation therapy treatments in the near future . 
Her neurological examination remained stable . 
Repeat head CTs done to assess for edema following the stroke revealed some effacement of the right lateral ventricle , but no threatening mass effect . 
Her serum sodium trended down throughout admission ; it is recommended that she not receive hypotonic fluids at rehab and that she be water restricted to 1L per day , and take salt as directed . 
Given her thrombocytopenia , it is recommended that antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel be held until her platelet count rises over 100 . 
It is also recommended that anticoagulation with therapeutic low-molecular weight heparin as bridge to warfarin with target INR 2-3 be restarted 2 weeks after her stroke , on 2/16/05 . 
She should follow up for neurological issues with Dr. Sagan of neurosurgery as well as her outpatient neurologist , Dr. Collin Krauskopf , at Cako Hospital ADDITIONAL COMMENTS : DISCHARGE CONDITION : Fair TO DO/PLAN : 1 . 
hold clopidogrel until plt > 100k 2 . 
start low-molecular weight heparin as a bridge to warfarin -LRB- target INR 2-3 -RRB- and discontinue clopidogrel 7/1/05 3 . 
Free water restrict 1L per day , follow serum sodium . 
4 . 
Follow up with Dr. Amoah in 2 weeks .
