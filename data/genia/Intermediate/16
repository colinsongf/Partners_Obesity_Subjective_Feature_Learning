HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mrs. Chepiga is a lovely 73yo woman who presented in 9/22 with 3 days of epigastric and chest pain and was found to have a STEMI . 
She subsequently underwent DES to ramus and LAD . 
Flow through the LAD was only TIMI 2 by the end of the procedure . 
Course was complicated by post-MI pericarditis , apical wall thinning , and mural LV thrombus . 
She was discharged initially to short-term rehab , then subsequently went home w / weekly f/u w / cardiac rehab . 
While at short term rehab , she was treated w / doses of lasix as high as 120 mg IV . 
Following discharge from rehab , she was ultimately taken off of diuresis b/c of `` dizzy spells '' she was experiencing while on lasix . 
She did well off lasix until 2 weeks ago , when she was noted to have decreased exercise tolerance and increasing fatigue at cardiac rehab . 
She says that she is usually able to ambulate for 15 minutes on the treadmill ; she has n't been able to do this for the past 2 weeks b/c of dyspnea and fatigue . 
This has been accompanied by new-onset PND -LRB- occurring as frequently as 3-5 times/night -RRB- , 5 pound weight gain , and increasing abdominal girth . 
She does acknowledge dietary indiscretion this past week -LRB- had a can of mushroom soup 4 days ago -RRB- . 
No orthopnea . 
Mrs. Bloxsom cardiac rehab . 
contacted Dr. Takach -LRB- her primary cardiologist -RRB- a few days ago to inform her about Mrs. Losey DOE and increasing fatigue . 
Starting 2 days ago , she was placed on lasix 40 mg . 
Since then , she has taken a total of 5 doses . 
She came to urgent care this PM and was noted to desat . 
to 85 % w / ambulation in the setting of fluid overload . 
She was subsequently admitted .
