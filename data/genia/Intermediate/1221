Pt reports 1 yr of weight loss and decreased PO more notable within past 1-2 wks . 
On ROS + sweating @ night o/w negative . 
Pt has been off her usual dose of lasix per renal input because on recent admit -LRB- 10/5 -RRB- she had elevated Cr thought to be prerenal , which is when lasix was stopped . 
No chest pain , pressure or palp .

Given clinical exam and CXR it appears that she is in decompensated CHF , and in worse renal failure . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 1 -RRB- Cardiovascular : She was in mildly decompensated CHF , and was started on more aggressive diuresis , starting with lasix 40 iv BID increased to 80 bid on HD2 as she was not meeting her diuresis goal . 
With cardiology service consulting , she was increase to lasix drip at 15/hr on HD3 , with i/o goal 1-2 l neg . 
She did well on this and by HD5 was near her dry weight of 49kg and her drip was transitioned back to PO lasix . 
She is no on lasix 80 po bid , which is felt to be adequate to maintain her dry weight . 
She was continued on Hydralazine , lopressol and was restarted on Isordil on HD3 , titrated up to 20 tid . 
She has history of MI with stents and was continued on Asa , Plavix , Zocor . 
He cardiac enzymes were negative . 
Her BNP fell from 3500 on admit to 1500 at her dry wt on HD6 . 
She was paced intermittent -LRB- pacer placed in past for sick sinus , functioning properly at a backup rate of 50 -RRB- . 
2 -RRB- Renal : She presented with acute on chronic RF possibly due to poor for forward flow in the setting of CHF decompensation . 
Cr up to 3.6 on HD3 , but as she diuresed , her Cr stabilized . 
Renal consult was following and recommended diureses , low K diet , good glucose control , and withholding ace inhibitor . 
She is discharge at her dry weight with a Cr stable at 3.5 . 
She should probably not go on Ace Inhibitor again . 
3 -RRB- FEN - Hyperkalemia w/o EKG change . 
Improved w / lasix . 
Rec 'd Kayexylate in ED . 
Now improved . 
Follow K/Mg . 
She should not be on an Ace inhibitor or a K-sparing diuretic . 
4 -RRB- ENDO - glipizide at home which was restarted on HD5 . 
Add insulin SS for tight control . 
TSH high . 
T4 low . 
This should be rechecked as an outpt before initiating therapy . 
5 -RRB- Heme - ON coumadin for history DVT . 
Held on HD3 for an INR 3.1 and was restarted shortly after , but her INR is 1.4 . 
She received 1.5 U of PRBC for goal HCT > 30 and is currently 30.8 . 
Her anemia is 2/2 chronic renal disease and she was started on darbopoetin 25 qwk . 
She developed a clot in her Right external jugular -LRB- site of prior IV -RRB- and was place on renal dose of lovenox until her INR > 2 . 
Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is > 2 . 
6 -RRB- Neuro - On dilantin for history of partial seizures . 
7 -RRB- Code - no CPR if sudden death , but intubation/defibrillation ok in the setting of instability . 
Dispo : She was discharged to Wadesdi Ckgart Community Hospital at a euvolemic state with a dry weight of 49kg . 
She should continue on 80 po lasix bid unless her Cr rises above new baseline of 3.5 or if she gains weight or shows signs of new overload . 
Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is > 2 . 
Coumadin dose should be adjusted according to INR goal 2-3 . 
She should be on a renal diet with low potassium and low glucose but with diabetic caloric supplements like GLUCERNA . 
She should receive a HOT PACK to her neck 2-3x per day and to her vein before blood draw for comfort . 
She should receive physical therapy daily with the goal of gait stability , home safety , and good O2 sats on 2L O2 . 
She should go home with home O2 at 2L and with VNA services for meds . 
She lives at home alone and it would be ideal if she had a relative stay with her for a few days to a week after going home . 
resume VNA services upon dc .
