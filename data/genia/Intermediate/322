She was transfused with 2 U PRBC initially , placed NPO , IVF and GI consult was obtained . 
GI took her to endoscopy and did upper endoscopy on morning of November . 
They found a friable ulcer located at an anastomosis site from her previous bypass surgery . 
No active bleeding and blood vessels were identified at the area . 
This represents the likely source of her bleed . 
2 more units of blood were ordered to keep goal over 30 but she only bumped to 26.6 from 20 after total of four units initially . 
It is possible the blood was drawn distal to where IVF was adminitered and there could have a been a dilutional effect .
