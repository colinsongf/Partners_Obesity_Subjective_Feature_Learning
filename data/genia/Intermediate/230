Severe , L sided , worse w inspiration & a/b nausea & diaphoresis ; no SOB . 
Pain not initially relieved by nitro . 
Presented to ED where EKG was without changes and enzymes neg but D Dimer elevated at 801 . 
Cont 'd to c/o chest pain ; heparin initiated , along w / ASA/Plavix -LRB- home dose -RRB- ; found to have HTN at SBP 235 b/l arms ; In the emergency department , she was treated with hydralazine , SL nitro , nitro drip and then pain free ; given lopressor 25 .

***** A/P : 77F w ho CAD p/w chest pain of sudden onset : Original ddx includes acs/usa/PE / hypertensive urgency or emergency/msk/chf . 
Given the excellenet response to heparin and a negative cardiac catheterization , and the continuoation of pain despite control of hypertension , the cardiac team felt that the most likely diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism . 
However , had neg lenis and PE CT , so unlikely PE . 
She was discharged home with follow up with Dr. Sollitto and with her usual PCP . 
Will need monitoring of lytes and Cr given possibility of contrast induced nephropathy in setting of underlying elev Cr . 
** CV : -LRB- i -RRB- : Chest pain was initially concerning for ischemic pain ; however , cardiac catheterization was unchanged from prior cath . 
She will continue asa/plavix/BB / statin ; she ruled out for MI w serial enzymes and ekgs . 
Given an intermediate to high probability story and an intermediate V-Q scan , she was continued on heparin and PE protocol CT of chest was obtained , which was neg for PE but showed a pulmonary nodule ; she will need repeat CT for nodule f/u in 6-12 months . 
Excellent oxygentation , stable walking and nearly pain free at time of discharge . 
-LRB- r -RRB- : no active issues , telemetry monitoring was nl . 
-LRB- p -RRB- : HTN , w ss , uptitrated labetalol for BP . 
** PULM : PE intermediate pretest prob - elev d dimer but no ekg changes , no o2 req , no known ca , no obvious dvt risks . 
lenis negative , PE CT neg , so PE considered unlikely , will not anticoagulate . 
Pulm nodule on CT , will need 6-12 month f/u scan . 
Of importance however , has pulm hypertension that is new on R heart cath and given no other explanation for sudden pressure changes -LRB- impressively higher since last cath -RRB- , may have primary pulm HTN . 
Given ground glass in lungs and pulm nodule , should have outpt pulm eval for pulm parenchymal disease in near future . 
** endo : DM on 70/30 at home . 
Poor control given HbA1c elev and high finger sticks in house . 
Chgd to nph and short acting pre-meal insulin for tight control . 
Pt agreed to incr freq of SC insulin for tight control , still high sugera in house . 
Wanted to send with NPH and short acting pre-meal regimen but pt refused to change home regimen despite repeated explanations of value of tighter control . 
Agreed that she would return to home regimen of 70/30 and f/u ASAP with Dr. Douglas Tippett of Endocrinology to optimize insulin regimen ; also should f/u with outpt pcp for titration . 
H/o hypothyroidism . 
TSH elevated ; gave script for 112 mcg of levoxyl -LRB- an increase -RRB- and contacted her o/p endocrinologist for follow up . 
** MSK : arthritis : oxycodone and tylenol prn ** FEN mag/k/calcium ** ppx : heparin while in house . 
** Code status : FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS : Work with your VNA for aggressive diabetes management . 
Please assess blood sugars and titrate insulin as per your doctor . 
Please assess blood pressures as well . 
Check your electrolytes with VNA in 1 week . 
Continue diabetes teaching . 
thank you DISCHARGE CONDITION : Stable TO DO/PLAN : Check Cr , lytes in 1 week by VNA given contrast load and risk of nephropathy . 
Pulmonary consult to eval for primary pulm disease . 
Repeat chest CT 6-12 months to f/u nodule.Titrate insulin by finger sticks at PCP . 
Monitor BP .
