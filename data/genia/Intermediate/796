060411605 | AALH | 49149115 | | 3729628 | 9/27/2002 12:00:00 AM | LEFT ATRIAL MYXOMA | Signed | DIS | Admission Date : 9/27/2002 Report Status : Signed Discharge Date : 11/28/2002 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr. Waycaster is a 70-year-old gentleman who went to see primary care physician and presented with aphasia . 
MRI was sent at that time , which revealed a left parietal infarct . 
A transesophageal echocardiogram was done , which revealed a large left atrial myxoma with prolapse across the mitral valve into the left ventricle with a pedunculated stock . 
The patient does not have symptomatic heart failure and is normal sinus rhythm . 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY : Significant for percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography and atherectomy with stent placement , history of recent cerebrovascular accident , diabetes mellitus , oral agent treatment , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , remote history of gout , chronic renal insufficiency , status post angioplasty and stenting procedures , and anemia . 
He is status post a right nephrectomy in 1999 , with renal cell carcinoma and right knee replacement in 2001 , and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the year 2001 . 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 4/26/02 , which revealed a left anterior descending coronary artery with a 40 % stenosis , first obtuse marginal coronary artery with a 60 % stenosis , a right coronary artery with a 60 % stenosis and a right dominant circulation , ejection fraction of 50 % . 
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on 1/9/02 which revealed the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Left ventricular cavity size with wall thickness and systolic function appeared normal with an ejection fraction of 55 % , with no akinetic areas seen . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- The right ventricle appears normal in size and systolic function . 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- The aortic valve is trileaflet without evidence of dysfunction . 
-LRB- 4 -RRB- The mitral leaflets appear mildly thickened . 
There is light retrace mitral regurgitation . 
The left atrium is enlarged . 
-LRB- 5 -RRB- A large heterogeneous multilobulated mass is seen within the atrium . 
It appears to be attached by a stalk to the interatrial septum . 
The mass measures approximately 7 x 3.5 cm and prolapses to the mitral valve and to the left ventricle . 
The distal portion of this mass has more mobile element . 
A mild amount of inflow obstruction is noted , and there is also mild valvular incompetence . 
The appearance of the mass is most consistent with myxoma , although other primary and secondary neoplasms are also possible . 
Thrombus is seen much likely , but superimposed thrombus formation overlying the main mass is possible . 
-LRB- 6 -RRB- The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
There is trace tricuspid regurgitation with peak velocity of 2.7 m/sec predicting pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 29 mmHg plus right atrial pressure . 
-LRB- 7 -RRB- There is no evident pericardial effusion . 
-LRB- 8 -RRB- No prior studies are available for comparison . 
-LRB- 9 -RRB- Findings reviewed with clinical team . 
The patient also underwent a MRI of the brain which revealed the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Left parietal infarct . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- Bilateral posterior communicating arteries . 
Otherwise , normal vasculature . 
The patient was seen by the neurology service who recommended that the patient did not proceed with his cardiac surgery at this time . 
He will be discharged to home and be readmitted on 2/19/02 in the year 2002 for his cardiac surgery . 
He has otherwise had an uneventful hospital course and will be discharged to home in stable condition . 
ALLERGIES : The patient has no known drug allergies . 
MEDICATIONS : Celexa 40 mg q.d. , atenolol 100 mg q.d. , allopurinol 100 mg q.d. , glyburide 5 mg q.a.m. and Lipitor 10 mg in the evening . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : CARDIAC : Regular rate and rhythm , with no murmurs , rubs or heaves . 
RESPIRATORY : Breath sounds clear bilaterally . 
NEURO : Alert and oriented with an expressive aphasia .
