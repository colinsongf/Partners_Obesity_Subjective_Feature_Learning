988105680 | PRH | 21384952 | | 294487 | 6/6/1998 12:00:00 AM | R/O MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date : 10/2/1998 Report Status : Signed Discharge Date : 11/27/1998 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA POST EXERCISE TOLERANCE TEST RECOVERY . 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES : 1 -RRB- HYPERCOAGULABILITY STATE WITH NEGATIVE SERUM WORK-UP . 
2 -RRB- RULE OUT RENAL CELL CARCINOMA ON THE LEFT -LRB- CT PENDING -RRB- . 
3 -RRB- HISTORY OF PPD POSITIVITY WITH CHEST X-RAY NEGATIVE . 
4 -RRB- GOUT . 
5 -RRB- CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE STATUS POST UNILATERAL ORCHIECTOMY . 
6 -RRB- HISTORY OF HEPATITIS A. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 70 year old man with coronary risk factors of hypertension , borderline hypercholesterolemia , remote tobacco with a history of hypercoagulability -LRB- negative work-up for protein C , S , activated protein C , factor V lydin , antithrombin III , anticardiolipin antibody , and homocystine level -RRB- , and multiple deep venous thromboses/pulmonary emboli requiring chronic anticoagulation and placement of an IVC filter in 11/20 He reportedly had a history of chronic shortness of breath and negative stress test for ischemia in 6/10 through 3/11/98 . 
A Holter monitor in 4/17 showed frequent premature ventricular contractions , 21 couplets , and no other arrhythmias . 
An echo in 10/28 showed an ejection fraction of 55 % , left ventricular hypertrophy , mitral valve prolapse with 2-3 + mitral regurgitation , and trace aortic insufficiency . 
A repeat Holter in 3/15 showed numerous premature ventricular contractions , PM bradycardia , sinus tachycardia , a rate of 113 , six triplets , and 172 couplets . 
On a stress test in 4/4 , the patient lasted two minutes and stopped secondary to atypical chest pain with a peak heart rate of 79 % of predicted and a peak blood pressure of 170 . 
There were no signs of definite ischemic and no clinically significant rhythm disturbance . 
The patient reported a vague history of arrhythmia in the Oven for which he was supposedly due to have a pacemaker placed . 
He denied ever being symptomatic with these arrhythmias . 
Over the last week , he had reported increasing fatigue and shortness of breath . 
The day of admission on his way to the clinic for an INR check , he reported chest tightness that was different from his previous pulmonary emboli , apparently 10/10 on presentation though he denied it after the fact associated with shortness of breath and fatigue with `` heavy heart beats '' . 
He denied associated symptoms of nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , light headedness , and palpitations . 
He denied congestive heart failure and syncopal symptoms over the last few weeks . 
In the Emergency Room , he had flat CK and a 0 troponin I and a stress test lasting three minutes and fifteen seconds . 
Patient stopped secondary to fatigue and not chest pain , however , three to five minutes after recovery , he developed a couple of episodes of nonmonomorphic wide complex tachycardia at a rate of about 150 lasting twenty to thirty beats during which time he was reportedly asymptomatic . 
The patient was admitted for evaluation of this possible ventricular tachycardia . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : History of multiple pulmonary emboli/deep venous thromboses with number one in 11/17 , status post TPA when echo showed right ventricular strain , number two in 6/28 , number three in 6/10 after one year of Coumadin , and number four in 2/11 status post IVC filter placement when patient bled into left renal cyst with goal INR of 3 to 3.8 . 
Patient had a negative hypercoagulability work-up , question of renal cell carcinoma which must be evaluated in the next two months , history of PPD positivity of 2 cm and negative chest x-ray , mitral valve prolapse and MR on echo , hypertensive borderline hypercholesterolemia , gout , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , status post unilateral orchiectomy , restrictive lung disease , history of a duplex 5 cm adrenal mass , negative 17 hydroxyketosteroids and VMA , and history of hepatitis A virus . 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS : Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cardura 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q.d. , and indomethacin q. 4h . 
ALLERGIES : Patient had no known drug allergies -LRB- hydrochlorothiazide was thought to cause gout exacerbations and ace inhibitor thought to cause cough , and beta blocker with urinary retention -RRB- . 
FAMILY HISTORY : Patient had a family history of cancer and no history of premature coronary disease , palpitations , or sudden death . 
SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient immigrated from the Georgia with his wife a few years ago , had a remote history of tobacco , occasional alcohol , and no drugs . 
He was a previous factory worker . 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS : Negative . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient is a 70 year old with a history of hypertensive borderline hypercholesterolemia , and hypercoagulability with multiple pulmonary emboli in the past who presented asymptomatically with a wide complex tachycardia that could not rule out ventricular tachycardia in the recovery phase of a full Bruce exercise tolerance test . 
The patient was admitted for Holter monitoring times 48 hours . 
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction . 
He was started on a cholesterol lowering agent , his Coumadin was held , and Heparin was started in the case of an invasive procedure . 
On 10/15/98 , the patient had an exercise tolerance test MIBI on an increased dose of beta blocker of 50 mg of Lopressor q. 8h . 
which showed that the patient exercised three minutes and fifteen seconds stopping secondary to leg pain from his deep venous thrombosis with a peak heart rate of 106 , peak blood pressure 150/80 , frequent premature ventricular contractions in couplets , no ST or T wave changes , and no chest pain . 
The patient then had an adenosine MIBI with a maximum heart rate of 81 and a maximum blood pressure of 180/70 . 
He did have chest pain after the infusion with T wave inversions in V5 through V6 and occasional premature ventricular contractions that were consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia . 
The MIBI images showed mild nonspecific inferior wall changes with some reversibility suggestive with but not conclusive of ischemia . 
The patient was discharged the following day on his usual out-patient medicines with the addition of an ace inhibitor , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , given his mitral regurgitation . 
He will continue his beta blocker at an increased dose , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , in addition to his Cardura and amlodipine . 
He was started on Zocor at 10 mg p.o. q.d. DISPOSITION : He will need out-patient echos to follow his mitral regurgitation and will need to be observed the higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation . 
He will also need a repeat stress test in the next couple of months when his leg pain completely resolves . 
From a hypercoagulability standpoint , his Coumadin was started at his usual out-patient dose of 6 mg p.o. q.p.m. with enoxaparin used as a bridge to anticoagulation until his INR is at least 3 . 
His goal INR is between 3 and 3.8 . 
He will have visiting nurse teach him to use the enoxaparin and will come to Coumadin Clinic at SHAVA HEALTHCARE every two to three days to have his INR level checked . 
A pelvic CT was scheduled on 8/14/98 at 2 p.m. to reevaluate his kidneys and rule out renal cell carcinoma . 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cardura 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. , nitroglycerin sublingual tablets 0.4 mg q. 5 minutes p.r.n. chest pain , indomethacin 25 mg p.o. q. 6h . 
, Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously q. 12h . 
until INR 3 , and Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q.p.m. FOLLOW-UP : The patient will follow-up with Dr. Darnell Wanca next week and was in stable condition upon discharge .
