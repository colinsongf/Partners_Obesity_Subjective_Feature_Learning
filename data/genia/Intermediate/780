EKG and enzymes negative , but CXR showed widened mediastinum . 
There was concern for dissection , so she underwent CT which was read as positive for dissection in ascending aorta . 
She was transferred to ISCH CCU for further care . 
Repeat CT here showed no dissection but did show extensive calficiations and luminal disease of the aorta . 
She was chest pain free here until 6/9 AM when she had chest pain again with ST depressions in V3-V6 at rest . 
She was made pain free with nitro and heparin and transferred to the cardiology floor with presumed unstable angina given her anginal pain , EKG ischemia changes , but lack of elevated cardiac enzymes . 
Echo 6/22/03 demonstrated EF 65 % with no RWMA , no aortic root dissection , no effusion , and normal RV function .
