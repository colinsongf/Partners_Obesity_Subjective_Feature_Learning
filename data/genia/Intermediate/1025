HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 61 year old female with coronary artery disease -LRB- status post PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft -RRB- who presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker placement . 
Ms. Debrecht 's pertinent medical history was significant for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease . 
In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional chest discomfort . 
Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance test was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol at six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST depression inferolaterally . 
Cardiac catheterization in 6/9 revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90 % and mid right coronary artery 99 % -LRB- with left-to-right and right-to-right collaterals -RRB- . 
The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20 % residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20 % then re-occluded again -LRB- no PTCA a third time -RRB- . 
Echo in 6/9 revealed an ejection fraction of 50 % , inferior hypokinesis consistent with prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen . 
Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels -LRB- LIMA to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal descending artery -RRB- was performed in 6/9 -LRB- Dr. Nethery -RRB- . 
Since then , she had done well with no further chest pain . 
Starting approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to experience episodes of near syncope . 
Episodes consisted of the sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and diaphoresis -LRB- although she felt near-syncopal , she had never actually experienced true syncope -RRB- . 
During episodes , she frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis . 
She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only when she was at rest -LRB- but not asleep -RRB- . 
Holter monitor on September , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses . 
The patient 's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol -LRB- 25 mg b.i.d. -RRB- was discontinued , however , repeat Holter on 10/9/96 revealed multiple pauses -LRB- 114 pauses in a 24-hour period -RRB- with the longest lasting 4.2 seconds . 
The patient was then sent to the Sa Ratee for further evaluation and management . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As described in Secondary Diagnoses above . 
SOCIAL HISTORY : Divorced , retired x-ray technician , former smoker of one pack per day times thirty years quitting eleven years ago , and history of ethanol consumption at the time of divorce . 
Her primary medical doctor was Dr. Armand Shackelford -LRB- Huban -RRB- . 
FAMILY HISTORY : Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 76 and history of hypercholesterolemia , mother died at age 86 of gastrointestinal ulceration and had a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and sister with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal ulcers . 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS : ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. -LRB- discontinued three weeks ago -RRB- , vitamin supplements -LRB- vitamin E , lysine , Co-Q10 , vitamin C , calcium , Centrum Silver , and primrose oil -RRB- , and no over-the-counter medications . 
ALLERGIES : Penicillin , Zantac , and Comtrex , all of which produce angioedema and tetracycline -LRB- sun sensitivity -RRB- . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Vital signs showed a blood pressure of 160/110 , pulse 92 , temperature 97.0 , respirations 16 , and 97 % on room air . 
GENERAL : Energetic white female in no apparent distress . 
HEENT : Extraocular movements intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynx without erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . 
NECK : Supple and carotids 2 + bilaterally without bruits . 
CARDIOVASCULAR : Regular rate and rhythm at 72 with no rubs , gallops , or murmurs . 
LUNGS : Clear to auscultation and percussion . 
ABDOMEN : Obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tube scars , and bowel surgery scar -LRB- right just lateral of the midline -RRB- , normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , no hepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits . 
EXTREMITIES : No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distal pulses were 1 + bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity . 
NEUROLOGICAL : Alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves II-XII intact , strength 5/5 , sensory intact , deep tendon reflexes 3 + bilaterally throughout , and toes downgoing . 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION : SMA 7 was remarkable for a potassium of 3.9 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liver function tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled 7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233 . 
PT was 12.3 -LRB- 1.1 -RRB- and PTT equalled 30.4 . 
Chest x-ray showed status post coronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acute air space disease and EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 with an axis of 60 degrees , T wave inversion in V2 to V3 with upright in V4 and V6 , and Q waves in II , III , and F. HOSPITAL COURSE : Patient is a 61 year old female with peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted for evaluation and management of near syncope . 
Holter monitor had demonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation of beta blocker -LRB- metoprolol -RRB- . 
The patient was admitted for observation over the weekend . 
She experienced multiple sinus pauses , particularly at nighttime . 
The longest pause recorded was 4.7 seconds . 
Though she was aware of the irregular heart rhythm , she never became truly syncopal or had evidence of hemodynamic instability . 
She was enrolled in the ECTH trial and underwent placement of a dual chamber pacemaker randomized to the VVIR mode on 9/10/96 . 
She tolerated the procedure without complication . 
Post-operative chest x-ray revealed appropriate location of atrial and ventricular leads and no evidence of pneumothorax . 
Interrogation of the pacemaker revealed appropriate response . 
The patient did well overnight and was discharged on May , 1996 with instructions to follow-up with Dr. Passarella in ten days . 
DISPOSITION : The patient is discharged on May , 1996 in good condition .

FOLLOW-UP : She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Lafranca on August , 1996 at 1 p.m. Dictated By : CHAUNCEY J. BRISBY , M.D. XN70 Attending : DALLAS W. MOORS , M.D. LH37 IG733/7767 Batch : 05462 Index No .
