Hospital Course by System : * CV : In ED , BP was 198/109 with HR 98 . 
Pt received given ASA 325 , Lopressor 5mg , Morphine 2mg , Nitro SL , Hydral 10mg , Dilaudid . 
BP decreased to 120/78 . 
EKG showed new T wave inversions in AVF and V6 with pseudonormalization of T wave in AVL . 
CT chest negative for dissection . 
Serial troponins were < 0.10 , 0.13 , < 0.10 , bump likely result of demand ischemia . 
As pt 's CP was reproducible on palpation , not likely to be of cardiac source , somewhat improved with narcotics . 
Pt maintained on home regimen , with BP control from 120-160/60 -90 in house . 
Echo showed severe LVH , EF 50-55 % , diastolic dysfunction , basal inferior akinetic , basal superior dyskinetic , mid-posterior hypokinetic , unchanged from prev . 
Pt will follow up with outpatient cardiologist Dr. Dodimead .

ESR was only mildly elevated at 32 . 
Pt is already on aspirin , Plavix , statin and BP meds for stroke prevention as per Neuro recs , though they recommended follow up with outpatient Rheum to w/u temporal arteritis if sx continue . 
Ophtho exam demonstrated typical dermoid in L eye -LRB- unrelated to sx -RRB- , retinal exam showed evidence of PVD but no emboli , consult thought presentation not consistent with giant cell arteritis , most likely atypical migraine .
