-- Hospital course : 1 . -RRB- 
Pulm - Pt treated for COPD flare with supplemental O2 , DuoNebs , and steroids . 
Since he reported left sided pleuritic chest pain , we evaluated the possibility of PE with a V/Q scan that reported a low probability of PE . 
2 . -RRB- 
CV - Pt 's physical exam demonstrated signs of right-sided heart failure , notably 12 cm JVD , hepatomegaly and later hepatojugular reflex , and 2 + bilateral lower extremity pitting edema . 
We proceeded to treat his heart failure by diuresis with Lasix , initially PO and then IV . 
Overall , he diuresed approximately 1L fluid . 
To further evaluate his heart failure , a cardiac MRI was obtained and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and function . 
His LVEF was 73 % and he had no valvular dysfunction . 
3 . -RRB- 
ID - Sputum was cultured which showed few polys , moderate cocci , 2 + suspected oral flora . 
Since he remained afebrile and did not demonstrate an elevated WBC , we did not treat with antibiotics . 
4 . -RRB- 
Endo - His diabetes was managed with his home regimen of Novolog . 
Steroids may have contributed to his elevated blood sugars . 
In a previous discharge summary , it was noted that he had an elevated TSH level . 
We followed up on this by rechecking his TSH , which was normal . 
5 . -RRB- 
Renal - He an elevated baseline level of Cr . 
We monitored his Cr and BUN for an increase with diuresis . 
While the BUN increased to the low 30s , his Cr was stable .
