Stents were placed to both the proximal and mid RCA lesions . 
In August of 2001 , the patient represented with substernal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test . 
Cardiac catheterization revealed in-stent restenosis . 
She was treated with angioplasty and brachytherapy .

Finally , in September of 2002 , the patient presented with her usual chest pain and a cardiac troponin I of 0.15 . 
MIBI showed inferior ischemia and cardiac catheterization showed an RCA instent restenosis . 
She underwent PTCA without stenting . 
Today , the patient presents complaining that she has had a sharp chest pain across the precordium with onset three days prior to admission and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin .
