In fact , your studies were improved from your previous studies of yoru heart . 
It seems that your pain is likely more due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we performed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart . 
When you have shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area -LRB- or ice if that helps more -RRB- as well as Tylenol . 
You may also try ibuprofen in small doses . 
Ibuprofen -LRB- also known as Advil or Motrin -RRB- is available in generic form in your drugstore . 
It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys so you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge summary . 
Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital we would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day instead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Your medications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your admission . 
If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or any other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention immediately .
