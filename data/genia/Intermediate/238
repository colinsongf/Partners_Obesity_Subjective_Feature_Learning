304946199 | BMC | 47548866 | | 7576393 | 7/12/2005 12:00:00 AM | CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date : 3/9/2005 Report Status : Signed Discharge Date : 1/21/2005 ATTENDING : REOPELL , ROLF M.D. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : This is the diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is sinus arrest with apnea . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy -LRB- EF of 55 % on this admission , although prior admission indicating an EF of 35 % -RRB- , diabetes , obstructive sleep apnea , obesity hypoventilation syndrome , atrial flutter status post ablation . 
On 5/24/05 , he presented with shortness of breath as well as a witnessed apneic episode . 
His recent history is significant for having stopped his Lasix dose one week prior to admission due to increased frustration with incontinence . 
Since then , he has had increasing shortness of breath , orthopnea , bilateral lower edema , and dyspnea on exertion to the point of symptoms upon walking 10 feet . 
In the Centsshealt Careman Inerist Medical Center Emergency Department , he was found to be saturating 91 % on room air and 99 % on a nonrebreather . 
An ABG showed a pH of 7.31 and a PCO2 of 55 ; he was tried on BiPAP without improvement in either PCO2 or PO2 . 
While being interviewed by the medical residents , he was seen to have a 30-second apneic episode with loss of consciousness and cyanosis ; his sensorium quickly returned after this event , although he retained no memory of this occurrence . 
He received Lasix 80 mg x1 , Solu-Medrol , and DuoNebs in the ED . 
He was admitted to the CCU initially with CHF/apnea/sinus arrest , and subsequently transferred to the hospital floor when he was stable .

SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient lives alone at Rys Ville Santster He is a retired Burg Bovalle Ge employee . 
He is an ex-smoker , quit in the 1960s . 
He is a heavy drinker in his 20s , but now he rarely drinks alcohol . 
FAMILY HISTORY : Gastric cancer in his father . 
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Temperature of 96 , pulse of 53 , blood pressure of 125/65 , and saturating 94 % on 2 liters by nasal cannula . 
In general , alert and oriented , in no acute distress . 
HEENT : Pupils are equally round and reactive to light , sclerae are anicteric , moist mucous membranes . 
Cardiovascular exam : Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , although JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus . 
Lung exam : Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no wheezes or crackles . 
Abdomen : Obese , soft and nontender , normal abdominal bowel sounds . 
Extremities : 2 + edema . 
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION : Notable for creatinine of 2.3 -LRB- at baseline -RRB- , BNP of 500 . 
His admission EKG : Sinus rhythm with occasional bradycardia to the 40s , no ST changes . 
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE : Assessment and Plan : A 71-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome , restrictive lung disease , diabetes , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , who was admitted for congestive heart failure , sinus arrest , ultimately treated with diuresis and a pacemaker placement . 
1 . 
Cardiovascular : Ischemia : No active issues during this hospitalization . 
Pump : The patient had a history nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , -LRB- an echo during this hospitalization revealed an EF of 55 % without hypokinesis , although prior echo in 2003 showed an EF of 35 % with global left ventricular hypokinesis -RRB- . 
On admission , the patient had signs and symptoms of volume overload in a setting of having not taken his Lasix for about a week . 
He was admitted initially to the CCU , and subsequently transferred to the floor , with aggressive diuresis of approximately 10 kg since admission -LRB- including diuresis with ultrafiltration in the CCU -RRB- . 
Following transfer to the floor , he was switched to Lasix diuresis , which was titrated down gradually to 40 mg daily , -LRB- cautioned with administration giving a rise in creatinine -RRB- . 
The patient was also maintained on captopril , which was up titrated to 25 mg t.i.d. -LRB- held at one point due to the rise in the creatinine -RRB- . 
The patient was also titrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. Rhythm : The patient was followed by the Electrophysiology Service . 
In the CCU , he was noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting of apnea . 
Following transfer to the floor , he was noted to have sinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea . 
His last such episode was on 8/16/05 . 
In addition , the patient has history of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation . 
On 4/30/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalic veins , which he tolerated well . 
2 . 
Pulmonary : The patient , as noted above , had several episodes of apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest . 
Following diuresis , the patient 's apnea episodes improved . 
He was recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient . 
3 . 
Renal : The patient was admitted with a creatinine roughly around baseline -LRB- 2 -RRB- , which rose briskly during his hospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 4/30/05 . 
His FENa on admission was 6-8 % ; a repeat FENa in the setting of his peak serum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was 1.86 % . 
His urine eosinophils were negative . 
His UA showed evidence of a UTI plus triple phosphate crystals ; urine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology . 
It was thought that the rise in the patient 's creatinine was likely due to a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly UTI . 
The patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemaker placement , which would be expected to cover GU microbial flora and SNHU microbes . 
4 . 
Endocrine : The patient had a history of diabetes and was maintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale . 
5 . 
ID : The patient was expected to having an UTI as noted above . 
Following his pacemaker placement , he was placed on cefazolin while in-house , followed by Keflex . 
The patient should stay on Keflex for four days .
