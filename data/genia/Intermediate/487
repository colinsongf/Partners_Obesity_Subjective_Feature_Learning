She experienced similar SOB on prior episodes . 
She has had no CP . 
Her SOB is primarily related to her body habitus . 
IN AHS ED , hypoxic to 80s on RA , up to 90s on 3L NC . 
Had clear CXR , Patient 's prior PE protocol was negitive though she did have a positive D-Dimer . 
In ED EKG was w / inf lat ST segment depressoions that were unchanged from prior . 
She also has LA enlargement . 
While in ED patient 's troponin returned 1.64 -LRB- prior less than assay a couple of days PTA -RRB- .

* Pulm HTN is also a possibility as a cause for her desaturation and SOB , but past echo was unable to get PA pressure due to body habitus . 
Mainstay of treatment now seems to be good respiratory rehab , use of CPAP in PM and ultimately weight reduction .
