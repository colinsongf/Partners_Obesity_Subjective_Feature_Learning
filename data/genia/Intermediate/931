162830105 | MNH | 45367796 | | 0066977 | 7/4/2003 12:00:00 AM | STROKE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date : 7/4/2003 Report Status : Signed Discharge Date : 8/26/2003 ATTENDING : AL DAMIAN DUMBAR MD ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS : Stented basilar occlusion . 
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS : None , Q-wave myocardial infarction . 
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES : Cardiac catheterization done on 3/14/03 . 
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION : This is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension and ____ fibrillation managed on aspirin and Plavix who presents to the Maven Health emergency department complaining of lethargy , diplopia and vertigo . 
Further information regarding her symptomatology is not currently available as the patient 's initial mental status was quite poor . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for hypertension , diabetes , glaucoma , hypercholesterolemia , history of alcohol abuse , history of coronary artery disease . 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Not available currently in detail but included aspirin 325 mg and Plavix 25 mg p.o. q.d. ALLERGIES : She is allergic to NSAIDs , penicillin and Diltiazem . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION : Revealed her to be lethargic , obese . 
Her face is slightly asymmetric with some left cheek swelling . 
Her neck revealed no bruits . 
Her heart was irregularly irregular . 
Her lungs revealed bibasilar crackles . 
Her extremities had 1 + pitting edema bilaterally . 
Neurologic examination : The only focal findings were a transient skewed deviation of her eyes . 
Further information regarding this is not currently available . 
Focal weakness and numbness were not delineated upon initial evaluation . 
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit given her initial imaging findings . 
These findings were that she had an occlusion , flat high-grade stenosis of the distal basilar artery . 
There was no acute infarction noted . 
Based on these findings , she was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit and placed on intravenous heparin . 
Her neurologic status gradually improved throughout her hospitalization . 
She did not complain of diplopia after the first day of her hospitalization . 
She also was quite awake after the first day of her hospitalization . 
Repeat magnetic resonance imaging done on 10/21/03 revealed a new left cerebellar infarct with persistent high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery which did appear a bit more patent than the initial scan done on 10/20/03 . 
At the time of her discharge , she was being transitioned from heparin to Coumadin and she was neurologically intact . 
With regard to her cardiovascular status , the patient initially ruled in for an MI based on positive cardiac markers . 
Her peak troponin-I was 11.02 and her peak CKMB was 18.4 . 
She had lateral T-wave inversions that were new compared to her old EKGs . 
She was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where it was found that she had multiple moderate stenoses but without any high-grade or critical stenoses . 
She was found however to have an elevated wedge pressure of approximately 30 cm . 
Echocardiogram done on 10/30/03 revealed an ejection fraction of 60 % . 
She had a mildly dilated left atrium . 
It was found that she had moderate tricuspid regurgitation . 
Her pulmonary artery pressures were elevated to 51 mL of mercury . 
She also is found to have moderate mitral regurgitation . 
Based on the findings of her catheterization and elevated wedge pressures , the patient was diuresed relatively aggressively . 
She was also given high doses of beta-blockade . 
Her troponin and CKMB levels did decrease after this . 
She remained weight controlled with beta-blockade . 
There was some discussion of possibly cardioverting her , but given her recent stroke this will be deferred . 
With regard to her blood pressure management , she has been managed while at an inpatient with hydralazine and Lopressor . 
A decision was made not to introduce an ACE inhibitor at this time given her recent _____ and her baseline renal insufficiency -LRB- 1.8-1 .9 -RRB- . 
The addition of an ACE inhibitor may be indicated at some point in the near future . 
DISCHARGE PLAN : The patient will be discharged to Mitent Health Hospital . 
FOLLOW UP PLANS : The patient will see her primary care physician , Marco Kenouo , at the Department of Medicine on 9/26/04 . 
She will see Dr. Doyle Ghamdi of Neurology on 2/12/03 at 4 p.m. . 
She will see Dr. Toney Montagna at the Department of Cardiology on 10/4/04 . 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , heparin drip being transitioned to Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. with goal INR of 2-3 , folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d. , hydralazine 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. , metoprolol 125 mg p.o. t.i.d. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Cosopt 1 drop o.u. b.i.d. , Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. eScription document : 1-6195237 EMSSten Tel Dictated By : GOODNIGHT , ZACHARY Attending : NIEDZWIECKI , JEROME WESTON Dictation ID 0448815 D : 1/15/03 T : 1/15/03
