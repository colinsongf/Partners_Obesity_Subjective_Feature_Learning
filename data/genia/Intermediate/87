BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE : 53 y.o african american woman w / HTN , hypercholesteroleia , morbid obesity presents with 1 month intermittent chest pressure sometimes associated with sob , diaphoresis .

amt . 
of inferolateral reversible ischemia , sum stress score 4 -LRB- 4-8 mild abnl -RRB- , and on echo , there is hypokinesis of inferolateral wall . 
LV is dilated , EF 45 % . 
Etiology of cardiomyopathy will need to be followed up with cardiologist , and because the area of reversible ischemia was so small , she will be medically managed .
