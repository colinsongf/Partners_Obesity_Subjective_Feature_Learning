Pt . 
felt somewhat nauseous on coming home from work on day PTA . 
Wife noticed pallor when he came home , called ambulance . 
Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which responded to lidocaine . 
Lidocaine drip d/c 'd in AM of transfer in the abscene of further VT. . 
Pt found to have troponin of 0.8 at outside hospital . 
It was initially unclear if the pt had an ischemic event which caused VT , or if the pt 's VT caused a bump in cardiac enzymes . 
Pt also has anginal equivalent w/jaw pain which worsens when the pt carries heavy things or walks up flights of stairs . 
Recent outside echocardiogram showed EF 15-20 % , w / global hypokinesis . 
PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles , II/VI SEM worse w/inc . 
afterload . 
EKG , unchanged from 11/1 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE 1 . 
Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiac service . 
Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , and clinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation was suspicious for CAD . 
The patient was initially diuresed slowly , however , the pt began to develop worsening HTN and shortness of breath along w/a prolonged episode of vtach and was subsequently diuresed aggressively by approximately 5 L . 
The patient was also loaded w/amiodarone . 
The patient 's weight also dropped 5 kg . 
Left and right coronary catheterization were performed and revealed only a discrete rt PDA lesion 60 % and a discrete 60 % D1 , otherwise essentially clean . 
No interventions were necessary . 
The right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP of 6 after the diuresis . 
The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodarone and was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone . 
The patient had an ICD placed on 3/16/2004 . 
The initial plan was for the patient to also have his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach , however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out during TEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred . 
An transthroracic echocardiogram was also performed prior to discharge which revealed EF of 30 % , w/anterior akinesis and global hypokinesis . 
A broad differential diagnosis for his heart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could be determined . 
The patient is to follow up with his cardiologist and his P CP . 
These appointments were coordinated by the attending physician , Dr. Versteegh . 
He should also follow up w/Dr . 
Yafuso as described in that section . 
For the patient 's afib , he should take coumadin , 5 mg , for the next three nights and should subsequently drop down to 2.5 mg qd , unless differently as suggested by his INR which should be drawn on Monday , May , and Wed September by the VNA . 
The patient should call an MD immediately w/chest pain , sob , or pallor . 
The patient 's blood pressure medications were also significantly adjusted to maximum doses while the patient was under close acute care monitoring to facilitate optimization of his outpt regimens . 
Additional changes at the discretion of the pt 's PCP , Dr. Schwarm . 
The patient also presented w/an elevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during the hospitalization . 
The elevated creatinine was most likely due to a combination of hypoperfusion secondary to vtach , and dye load from catheterization . 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS : DISCHARGE CONDITION : Stable TO DO/PLAN : F/u as described above . 
INR on June . 
Stop old medications . 
Take only medications as prescribed from here .
