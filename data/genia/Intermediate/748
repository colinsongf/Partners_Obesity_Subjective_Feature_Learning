PSORIASIS . 
CERVICAL DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE . 
STATUS POST COLECTOMY . 
STATUS POST RIGHT HERNIA REPAIR . 
KNOWN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE . 
STATUS POST NON Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN 1989 . 
STATUS POST LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING PTCA IN 1989 . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 61-year-old white male with known cardiac disease , status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in 1989 , status post left anterior descending PTCA in 1989 , who was admitted following an episode of post myocardial infarction chest pain from an outside hospital . 
Cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , history of myocardial infarction . 
Cardiac history dates back to 3/21 when the patient experienced substernal chest discomfort and ruled in for non Q wave myocardial infarction . 
A cardiac catheterization showed 95 % left anterior descending lesion , left circumflex 70 % lesion and diffuse right coronary artery disease . 
He had PTCA of the left anterior descending lesion and did well for approximately two months but was readmitted at that time in 6/11 with recurrent chest discomfort . 
A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 30 % left anterior descending lesion , 40 % circumflex lesion and 80 % OMB3 lesion and 50 % mid and distal RCA stenoses . 
He had no angina until approximately two days prior to admission when he presented to an outside hospital with substernal chest discomfort . 
He rule in for an inferior myocardial infarction with CK peaking at 2316 . 
He was treated with morphine , IV nitroglycerin , aspirin , heparin and IV streptokinase . 
He had recurrent chest discomfort post myocardial infarction and was transferred to Vu Pe Headcount Hospitals . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : On admission , the patient 's medications were optimized to increase his beta blockade . 
Eventually , the patient was weaned from IV nitroglycerin and IV heparin to oral nitrates . 
The patient had no further chest discomfort during the admission and had a predischarged modified Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test . 
He did have some episodes of shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure , however , this resolved with Lasix . 
EKG was consistent with inferior myocardial infarction on transfer . 
On 6/9 , he had a modified Bruce protocol stress test for which he went nine minutes without chest discomfort or shortness of breath . 
This was read as evidence of no ischemia .
