Over past 2-3 months the patient has had burning epigastric pain . 
Previous anginal chest pain per pt . 
was chest tightness , but given her history of CAD her epigastric pain has been investigated for an ischemic cause . 
The patient underwent PET CT 2 months prior that revealed an LvEF of 70 % , no wall motion abnormalities , and inferiolateral and basal anterolateral wall ischemia -LRB- reversible at rest -RRB- , in the distribution of the LCx . 
She presented to her PCP 12/10 to review these findings and complained of current epigastric burning . 
She was sent as a direct admit for evaluation of ischemia and possible catheterization . 
PMH : GERD , HTN , DMII , CAD LAD/Lcx/OM , CVA w / resolving Rt. hemiparesis , s/p CCY , osteoporosis , hyperplastic rectal polyp , ASCUS 98 allergies : NKDA SH : does not smoke or drink Exam : Tm AF P 46 , BP 138/70 sat 99 % RA PE : notable for physiologic split S2 , prominent S2 , no murmurs/rubs/gallops , o/w normal exam . 
EKG : old 1mm st depressions v4-6 , I. Labs : troponin < assay . 
Impression : This is a 75 yo woman with multivessel CAD with epigastric burning , possibly GERD but given risk for ischemia and positive PET CT deserves diagnostic catherization and intervention to relieve any pain caused by ischemia . 
Hospital Course . 
1 . 
card - ischemia : The patient ruled out for acute myocardial infarction by EKG and cardiac biomarkers . 
She was continued on her outpatient regimen of ASA/BB/statin / ACEI/plavix . 
Left heart catheterization performed 10/25 shows LCx disease with an 80 % mid LCx lesion opened to 0 % with TAXUS stenting . 
Additionally , a TAXUS stent was applied to an 80 % ostial occlusion of the OM1 with no residual occlusion . 
RCA disease was present with proximal 40 % and ostial 50 % occlusions that required no intervention . 
During the procedure the patient experienced bradycardia to 38 and SBP 86 . 
IV fluids were given with recovery of systolic pressure to 90 - 150s , and HR 40s . 
The patient was asymptomatic during this event , and has not had any complications . 
The patient experienced bleeding after the procedure and integrilin was stopped after two hours of treatment . 
The patient has had no further episodes of bleeding or associated chest pain and is discharged in excellent condition on her outpatient regimen . 
rhythm - the patient was asymptomatic at a rate of 40s - 50s during her hospital course . 
Titration of her beta-blockade as an outpt . 
may be considered if the patient becomes symptomatic . 
2 . 
GI - continue H2 blocker , switch to nexium if continued pain . 
3 . 
Endo - Hypoglycemics were held until after the procedure and should be resumed on discharge . 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS : 1 . 
resume your previous medications 2 . 
you have had two new stents placed to keep the vessels around you heart open . 
DISCHARGE CONDITION : Stable TO DO/PLAN : 1 . 
f/u rate control as outpt , adjust BB if pt .
