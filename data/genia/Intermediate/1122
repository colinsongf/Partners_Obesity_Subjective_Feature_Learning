***** Procedures : none Consultants : none ***** HOSPITAL COURSE : This is a 86F with hx CHF , Afib , CKD , and diabetes who was admitted with partial SBO , bilateral aspiration pneumonia , and CHF exacerbation . 
- GI : Admitted with partial SBO . 
She was treated wtih conservative management . 
No NGT was required . 
The SBO resolved and she was passing stool and tolerating a normal diet . 
- CV : She has a history of diastolic dysfunction . 
Echo 8/27 with EF 45-50 % , no RWMA , mod LAE and RAE , bioprosthetic MV w / tr MR , tr AR , severe TR , mild-mod PR . 
She reported SOB prior to admission which ws thought to be due to a CHF exacerbation . 
She was not agressively diuresed in the setting of the partial SBO . 
She is on variable doses of lasix -LRB- 80-200mg po bid -RRB- at home . 
She was initially given lasix 80mg bid which required additional doses of lasix iv prn to diurese , so the dose was increased to 160mg po bid . 
Repeat CXR on 3/17 looks a little better than admission . 
Overall her SOB and hypoxia improved . 
She no longer required supplemental oxygen . 
She has a history of hypertension and was continued on norvasc and imdur . 
She also has a history of Afib , now on coumadin . 
Her rate was adequately controlled . 
The coumadin was initially held due to possible procedures related to the SBO . 
The INR remained in 2-3 range , likely due to the antibiotics . 
The Coumadin was restarted on 10/20 as the INR was trending down , and was started at lower dose -LRB- 2mg instead of 3mg -RRB- given the antibiotics . 
Her INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient . 
- Pulmonary : She has a history of aspiration PNA . 
The Abd CT showed bilateral lower lobe PNA , likely aspiration . 
She was treated with levo and flagyl . 
Her WBC was elevated on admission and decreased during hospitalization . 
She was afebrile . 
With treatment of the pneumonia and CHF she was no longer hypoxic or SOB . 
She will continue levofloxacin and flagyl for an 8-day course . 
- Renal : She has a history of CKD with Cr baseline of 2.6-2 .8 . 
Her Cr was 2.6 on admission and 2.3 on discharge . 
She continued home sevelamer . 
- Diabetes : Her insulin was initially held on admission due to NPO for the SBO . 
When her SBO resolved and she was eating again , her home regimen of lantus 100 units daily , Novolog 5 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale was restarted . 
Her fingersticks continued to be high , perhaps due to pneumonia . 
The insulin was titrated up for better glucose control to Lantus 12 units daily , Novolog 7 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale . 
The daughter is a nurse and will monitor and adjust her insulin at home . 
HbA1c 8.2 . 
- ID : Treatment for aspiration pneumonia as above with levofloxacin and flagyl . 
Ucx with mixed flora . 
- Heme : Hct at baseline . 
As above , her INR remained high off coumadin , likely due to the antibiotics . 
Coumadin restarted on 10/20 at a lower dose . 
INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient - Nutrition : She had a radiologic swallowing evaluation which showed deep laryngeal penetration with thin and nectar-thick liquid with no aspiration and a tiny Zenker diverticulum . 
Diet recommendations were ground diet -LRB- for lack of teech -RRB- and thin liquids .
