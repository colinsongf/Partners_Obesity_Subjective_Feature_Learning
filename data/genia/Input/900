","Given limitations of imaging modalities due to his severe spinal stenosis , MIBI/ETT were not feasible , so the patient presented for elective catheterization 5/16/06 . ","Upon catherization , two occlusions were noted in the PLV : a 90 % occlusion , as well as a moderate sized plaque . ","Revascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alluding stents to these lesions ; the original 90 % lesion was stented to 0 % occlusion . ","During the catheterization , Dr. Taran noted a gradient of 40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising the possibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Mcconnell \u0027s severe lower back pain and limited ability to ambulate . ","The catheterization was without complications . ","The patient was placed on Plavix x 6 weeks and Aspirin indefinately following the procedure , and continued on his home regimen of Captopril , Metoprolol , Isordil , Digoxin , Spironalactone , Insulin , Lasix , Zocor and prn Nitroglycerin . ","Groin sheaths were removed and the patient was without hematoma or bruit . ","He had 2 episodes of chest pressure several hours following the procedure with negative EKG and stable vitals ; the symptoms resolved with oxycodone and did not recur . ","On discharge he was ambulating confortably without chest pain or shortness of breath . ","ADDITIONAL COMMENTS : Please take your Aspirin and Plavix . ","The Aspirin needs to be taken every day on a long term basis , and the Plavix must be taken for ATLEAST 6 WEEKS from 10/29 DISCHARGE CONDITION : Stable TO DO/PLAN : Please follow up with your Cardiologist , Dr. Golaszewski Please take your Plavix 75mg for 6 weeks -LRB- until atleast 3/12/06 -RRB- Take your Aspirin 325mg indefinately Please reschedule appointment with Dr. Kuick to receive steroid injections for spinal stenosis until AFTER your course of Plavix is complete No dictated summary ENTERED BY : YUEH , EARL D. , M.D. -LRB- NQ38 -RRB- 3/8/06 @ 11 ****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ****** "]}
