","HOSPITAL COURSE : Mr. Alexander Chadwick Rucker was admitted for increasing cough , left lower extremity edema for presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation . ","Hospital course by systems : 1 -RRB- Cardiovascular . ","The patient was noted to be in new onset congestive heart failure . ","He was aggressively diuresed . ","It was noted on admission that patient was in atrial flutter with pacing at a rate of approximately 110-120 . ","An electrophysiology consult was obtained and pacer was interrogated and mode changed to DDI from DDD . ","The patient was loaded on digoxin and subsequently spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm . ","2 -RRB- Pulmonary . ","The patient was noted to have a persistent pleural effusion that was new since the patient \u0027s coronary artery bypass graft one month previous . ","Although it was suspected that this was likely secondary to congestive heart failure or perhaps postoperative pleural effusion , etiology was unclear . ","A pulmonary consult was obtained . ","The patient did undergo a diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis of 500 cc of fluid . ","Analysis of the fluid showed a pH of 7.48 , total protein of 4.8 -LRB- serum total protein 7.6 -RRB- , LDH of 158 -LRB- serum LDH 228 -RRB- , glucose 135 , amylase 33 with 600 white blood cells , 6 polys , 0 bands , 56 lymphs , 13 monos , 18 macrophages and 7 , 000 red blood cells . ","No PMNs were noted . ","Cytology was still pending at the time of discharge . ","Though the pleural effusion did meet criteria for an exudate , this was difficult to interpret in light of the patient \u0027s recent aggressive diuresis . ","As fluid did not appear to be inspected . ","A PPD with control was planted which was negative , however controls were also anergic . ","Sputum cultures were negative . ","It was felt that the patient would likely benefit from repeat thoracentesis to remove enough fluid so that subsequently chest CT could be performed . ","This was to be pursued as an outpatient . ","DISPOSITION : The patient was discharged on 7/27/99 with a home VNA and physical therapy services for vital signs monitoring and post coronary artery bypass graft rehab services . ","FOLLOWUP : The patient was to follow up with Dr. Ladika on 3/5/99 in the chest diseases clinic , as well as with Dr. Thayne , his outpatient cardiologist .
