","The patient is to follow up with Dr. Galla in two weeks and Dr. Caracciolo who is the attending in two weeks . ","He should also follow up with Dr. Smutzler , cardiology in 2 months , and Dr. Parramore , GI in 2-4 weeks . ","HOSPITAL COURSE : This is a 72-year-old male admitted for an incarcerated chronic ventral hernia , postoperative day 6 , status post sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann \u0027s operation . ","Hospital course was complicated by postoperative acute respiratory failure , respiratory acidosis with metabolic acidosis , pleural effusion , hypokalemia , myocardial infarction , thrombocytopenia , and delirium . ","He has a known history of penile cancer status post penectomy complicated by perineal urethrocutaneous fistula , chronic anemia requiring transfusions , non-insulin-dependant diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , obesity , and recurrent UTIs . ","The patient had a suprapubic catheter placed by Urology . ","His postoperative course otherwise was alright . ","He started having atrial fibrillation on 7/28/07 , initially remained stable with normal blood pressures . ","He was transferred to the floor on 7/28/07 , wherein he developed rapid ventricular response to 120 . ","On 6/6/07 , he began hypotensive with systolics of 70 . ","Cardiology was consulted . ","He was initially treated with Lopressor and diltiazem drip . ","He remained hypotensive despite IV boluses . ","He was switched to amiodarone mode and drip , but again he became hypotensive . ","Therefore he was transferred to the unit and given a digoxin load and was transferred for a possible electrocardioversion .

","He did have an episode of bright red blood from his NG tube in the ICU and GI was consulted . ","They felt given that his hematocrits have stabilized after two units of packed cells , he did not need to be urgently scoped . ","He was started on Pepcid IV and a Nexium drip , and had hematocrit measured q. 6 h. , which remains normal . ","He was transferred back to the floor on these medications and was started on TPN after a PICC line was placed and continued to do well . ","He was scoped by GI on 3/24/07 , which showed diffuse gastritis thought to be due to the NG tube , and two ulcers turned out bleeding . ","Postprocedure , he was started on Carafate and was transferred to Nexium p.o. after he was taking a diet . ","Again , his PICC line was safe on 4/15/07 and he was started on TPN on 9/25/07 . ","The NG tube was removed on 3/24/07 and his diet has been slowly advanced . ","He is being discharged on TPN as his total caloric needs are still not being met by p.o. nutrition and he is in good condition on discharge . ","He was not anti-coagulated for his Atrial Fibrillation due to his risk of GI bleeding , as decided by GI .
