","-- CV : The cause of her high BP is not clear . ","There is no indication of med non-compliance . ","Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her . ","Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor . ","She was resumed on her home dose of Labetolol . ","There was discussion of increasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary . ","In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms of feeling lightheaded . ","Therefore her hold parameters were increased to 130 systolic .

","A renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis . ","UPEP , SPEP and spot urine/protein were ordered . ","Her spot urine protein was 222 . ","Her proteinuria in a chronic problem . ","UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up as outpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low . ","-- ENDO : The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home .
